# Graded-Unit

This is the project I created for my Graded Unit during second year which invovled me creating an invoice system for a retro gaming store.

# What I Used!

With this project it was my first time using Hibernate which is a way to map an Object with a table in a database by linking the attributes of the class with the attributes of the table and the relationships between the tables mapped in the classes using XML which was also my first time really implementing XML in a project. It was also my first time actually using FXML and Scene Builder to create a GUI for the project by dragging and dropping the buttons or whatever I needed and then creating controllers for each of these FXML files to then give these UI functionallity.
